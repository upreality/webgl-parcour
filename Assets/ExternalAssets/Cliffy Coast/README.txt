Thank you for your purchase!
Here are a few things that are good to know:

Configurable House Creator:
Just add an empty GameObject and assign the "LPS_ConfigureHouse.cs" script to it. Add the HousePartsList (simply choose it by clicking on the little circle), and once you've chosen your settings, hit update to refresh. 
You can also randomize houses to quickly create different houses in a scene.

URP / HDRP Support:
If you want to use this pack for URP or HDRP Render Pipelines, please go to:
Edit->Render Pipeline -> Upgrade Project Materials

Water and Skybox:
If you want to have the same water and skybox as in the demo screenshots, please find the assets here:

PostProcessing:
To get the same look as on the demo screenshots, please import the post processing stack from the Package Manager
Window -> Package Manager, install Post Processing
Now you can use the included post processing profile. For convenience, a profile for the old post processing stack is also included.
